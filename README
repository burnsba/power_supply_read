power_supply_read

This program is designed to be used with an Agilent power supply over a serial port, specifically the E3646A (though it should work with any E364xA device). It will periodically poll the power supply over the serial port to collect voltage and current; this can be logged to a text file in real time.

Several other configuration settings can be changed. (Really, the user manual for the power supply is the best source of information; many of the commands are suported here)

how to run:
1) use windows
2) use visual studio
3) compile

alternatively, see the bin/debug/ folder for an .exe
